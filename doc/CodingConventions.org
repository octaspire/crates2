#+TITLE: Coding Conventions for Crates2

* Naming

Use all lower case in code. When mentioning
names in comments or documentation, use all
upper case.

Example:

#+begin_src lisp
(defun head-on-collision-p (v1 v2)
  "Predicate telling whether velocities V1 and V2 can cause
head on collision - i.e. if the velocities are in opposite
directions.")
#+end_src

** Predicate Names

Names of predicate functions must end with ~P~.
If the function name is one word, the ~P~ is to
be added right to the end of the word. If the
name consists of multiple words, the ~P~ must
be added as a separate last word to the name.

Example:

#+begin_src lisp
(defun head-on-collision-p (v1 v2))
(defun runningp ())
#+end_src
