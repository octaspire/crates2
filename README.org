#+TITLE: Crates 2 - Puzzle Game

* About

~crates2~ is a WIP puzzle game. More information
is to be added.

*Please note that this is still Work In Progress.*

* Getting Started

Prerequisites:

At this stage: =Common Lisp= implementation (tested with SBCL), =Quicklisp= and =make=.

Get sources and build by issuing commands:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/octaspire/crates2.git
cd crates2
make
#+end_src

If you haven't cloned into directory that is known
to Quicklisp, you can tell about it by linking
or copying file ~etc/crates2.conf~ to
~$HOME/.config/common-lisp/source-registry.conf.d/crates2.conf~.
But please note, that the path given in that file probably
has to be changed to match the location of the cloned directory
on your machine.

* Development

GNU Emacs with slime, having crates2 loaded,
can be launched by issuing the following command:

#+begin_src shell
make slime
#+end_src
