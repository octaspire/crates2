* Getting Started
** Prerequisites

At this stage: =Common Lisp= implementation (tested with SBCL and CCL64), =Quicklisp=, =make=,
=libffi=, =SDL2=, =SDL2-image=, =SDL2-mixer=, =SDL2-ttf=, =GL=, =GLU=, and =GLEW= libraries.

*** Cloning and Building

Get sources and build by issuing commands:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/octaspire/crates2.git
cd crates2
make
#+end_src

If you haven't cloned into directory that is known
to Quicklisp, you can tell about it by linking
or copying file ~etc/crates2.conf~ to
~$HOME/.config/common-lisp/source-registry.conf.d/crates2.conf~.
But please note, that the path given in that file probably
has to be changed to match the location of the cloned directory
on your machine.

If =libffi= is not found on a UNIX like system, the
following change to file
=$HOME/quicklisp/dists/quicklisp/software/cffi_0.23.0/libffi/libffi.lisp=
might help:

#+begin_src diff
-  (:unix (:or "libffi.so.7" "libffi32.so.7" "libffi.so.6" "libffi32.so.6" "libffi.so.5" "libffi32.so.5"))
+  (:unix (:or "libffi.so.7" "libffi32.so.7" "libffi.so.6" "libffi32.so.6" "libffi.so.5" "libffi32.so.5" "libffi.so"))
#+end_src

You can also build and run by issuing command:

#+begin_src shell
make run
#+end_src

To install and start playing from level 20:

#+begin_src shell
make install && make play level=20
#+end_src

** Platform Specific Notes
*** OpenBSD

To use crates2 in OpenBSD without Common Lisp REPL - i.e. by running the generated
=crates2= executable directly - the =crates2= executable must be first
copied into ~/usr/local/bin~. This is because of the ~W^X~ protection
that OpenBSD uses. Command ~make run~ does this automagically in =OpenBSD=,
if file ~/etc/doas.conf~ has lines:

#+begin_src shell
permit nopass USERNAME as root cmd /bin/cp args crates2-text /usr/local/bin/
permit nopass USERNAME as root cmd /bin/cp args crates2-charms /usr/local/bin/
#+end_src

where ~USERNAME~ is your username. If you are getting error message

#+begin_src shell
RWX mmap not supported, is the current filesystem mounted with wxallowed?
#+end_src

in OpenBSD, then copying the executable to ~/usr/local/bin~ should fix the issue.

* Development

GNU Emacs with slime, having crates2 loaded,
can be launched by issuing one of the following
commands:

#+begin_src shell
make slime-text
make slime-charms
make slime-sdl2
make slime-sdl2-opengl
#+end_src
